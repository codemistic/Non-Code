<h1 align="center">Roadmap for DSA (Data Structure and Algorithms)</h1>

<h5 align="justify">Todayâ€™s world is highly reliable on data and their appropriate management
through widely used apps and software. The backbone for appropriate 
management of data is Data Structure and Algorithms. It is a dream for many to achieve expertise in
handling and creating these apps and software. With this target in mind,
they set out on the journey of learning DSA. The very first step in the 
journey is the creation of a complete roadmap to learn data structure and algorithms.</h5>

<h5 align="justify">There are 5 main steps in learning DSA.</h5>

1. <h3>Learn at least one Programming Language</h3>
2. <h3>Learn about Complexities</h3>
3. <h3>Learn Data Structure and Algorithms</h3>
4. <h3>Practice On Various Platforms</h3>
5. <h3>Compete and participate in contest</h3>

<h3>Learn at least one Programming Language</h3>

<h5 align="justify">There are 250-2,500 coding/programming languages to learn, your task is to choose one of them as per your convinience
and start learning process. Personally I prefer to learn C++ programming language. Sharing steps to learn C++.</h5>

<h5 align="justify">
   
   
1. Flowcharts
   
2. Conditionals(if,else if, else)
   
3. Loops(for, while, do while)
4. Patterns (for better understanding of loops)
5. Operators
6. Functions
7. Bit Manipulation
8. Pointers
9. Dynamic Allocation</h5>

<h3>Learn about Complexities</h3>

<h5 align="justify">Space and Time define any physical object in the Universe. Similarly, Space and Time complexity can define the effectiveness
of an algorithm. While we know there is more than one way to solve the problem in programming, knowing how the algorithm 
works efficiently can add value to the way we do programming. To find the effectiveness of the program/algorithm, knowing
how to evaluate them using Space and Time complexity can make the program behave in required optimal conditions, and by 
doing so, it makes us efficient programmers.</h5>

<h3>Compete and participate in contest</h3>

<h5 align="justify">The most important part during preperation is to excel DSA and problem solving, and to do so you must participate in contest on various platforms.
It will boost your confidence to face any SDE interviews.</h5>
