Getting Started with DSA:-

To start with DSA, one can purchase course on any edtech platforms or can buy it from some offline institutes.

But in this article I will be focusing entirely on free resources.

So there are two situations:-
  1) You don't have any knowledge of any programming language.
  2) You know basics of any OOPs based language (Java,C++,Python).
 
  1) If you don't have any prior knowledge of any OOPs based programming language then start to learn from Youtube (preferably C++), there are many playlists out there.
  
      After learning c++, move on to the next situtation.
  
  2) If you have basic knowledge of C++, then register on HackerRank and start solving problems based on  the programming language you have learned.
   
  Now learn basic STL in C++ or anything similar in java/python.
  
  Now make profile on any of the online judge like CodeChef and CodeForces.
  
  Start practising problems sorted in increasing difficulty order.
  
  After practising on these sites for 20-25 days you will feel confident.
  
 Now get started with the Data Structures, Refer to this playlist for DSA in C++, believe me this is the best free resource on the internet.
 
 	DSA Playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDzeHZWIZsTryvtXdMr6rPh4IDexB5NIA
  
 	You can skip the topics which is already taught.
 	
If you are comfortable in learning by reading you can also visit Geek For Geeks, they have all the algos and data structures on their website.

Once you have studied till array, make profile on GFG or LeetCode and start practising out there by sorting the problems in increasing dificulty order.

That's it.

Once you have completed the course, just don't stop practising, DSA is like maths once you stop practising you will loose your grip.

Happy Learning :)
