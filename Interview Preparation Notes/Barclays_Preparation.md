# BARCLAYS OA + INTERVIEW

## Round 1: Online Assessment(1.5 hrs)
This round consisted of 30 mcqs from the topic:

* Java
* C++/C
* Python
* Servlet
* SQL
* MongoDB
* OOPS
There were output based questions from Java, C++, C, Python and SQL as well as theory questions from MongoDB and Servlet.

I answered all the questions as there was no negative marking. Also the weightage of mcqs were more than that of coding questions.

Then there were 2 coding questions: 1 easy and 1 moderate.

* Coding Question 1:- [Calculate Cost](https://www.hackerearth.com/problem/algorithm/calculate-cost-ecebf9f8-444b018f/)

All my test cases passed in this question.

* Coding Question 2 :- Max Divisor Tree. In this question we were provided with a tree whose property was that each of its nodes branched out to the nodes with a value equal to one of its divisors(except 1 and itself). We had to return the maximum height that tree could have. In this question I passed 10/11 test cases.

### Tips for clearing this round:

* Proper time management.(For eg: If you are stuck at a coding question then instead of wasting time there jump onto mcqs)
* Always start with coding questions because once you start the mcqs there is no coming back as the doubtful questions in that section take up most of your time.
* Be very thorough with your basic concepts. They are the key for solving mcqs in this round.

## Round 2: Tech+HR Interview(20–30 min)

31 students were shortlisted for this round. It started at 5 in the morning and since I was the 5th one, I had mine scheduled at 7. But since the interviewer was taking the interviews for only 15–20 min, my turn came much before the scheduled time. In Barclays, interviewers are vice-presidents who have a lot of knowledge about technical stuff. So make sure that you don’t bluff in your resume.

It started with “Tell me about yourself.” Always keep this prepared beforehand so that you start this round with confidence and maintain the same throughout. Next he asked me technical questions and also gave me questions to code. They included:

* Draw a 3 cm line using graphics.h header
* Find middle elements of a 2d matrix
* Implement traversal in doubly linked list
* Difference between inner and outer join
* Firewall in OS
* File Handling in C++
* After this he concluded the interview by asking if I had any questions for him. Always be prepared for some questions for the interviewer based on the company and its programs.

### Tips for clearing this round:

* Sleep well and be prepared at least 1 hr before.
* Research about the company and its various programs beforehand so that you can mention it in your answers. This will show your interest in the company.
* Again be familiar with basics like implementation of various data structures.
* Prepare one object oriented language well
* Also be ready with questions from core subjects.
* Generally Barclays always asks about its RISES values so do study them and be ready with your perspective on them.
* Also prepare everything that is on your resume.
* Next day the list of 23 selected students came and I was one of them. Always trust your preparation and do smart work. Be honest with yourself and the interviewer. It will definitely help you in the long run.
