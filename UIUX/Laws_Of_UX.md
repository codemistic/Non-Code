Hello, I am [Anshika Srivastava](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anshikasriv/)!

I am writing this guide to make the budding designers aware about various rules they should keep in mind while designing an effective user interface.

## 5 LAWS OF UX DESIGN

User Experience is everything that affects a user’s interaction with that product. In some cases, however, your design can be totally unnecessary because you didn’t adhere to the rules of UX design. In this article, I would be mentioning about 5 UX laws that can hold a very important position in your designing process.

### 1. Hick's Law:

Hick’s law conveys that, the time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices. For example, have a look at the two ‘rate our service’ designs:

Its very obvious that design on the left is more user-friendly and doesn’t leave the user overwhelmed by innumerable choices unlike the one on right.

### 2. Fitt's Law:

Fitts’ law says that the time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target. You can shorten the time by making it huge enough and placed on the bottom to make it easy to reach.

Now lets analyze 2 basic designs:

Out of the above mentioned designs, it is clear that design A would be easy to acquired by the target due to its optimum distance between 2 target points.

### 3. Jakob's Law

Users spend a lot of time on other websites and apps. This creates an expectation that your website or app will look and function in the same way.
As per Jakob’s law, you should develop your new project similar to other known projects.
This makes it very convenient for user while switching sites.

Similarities between Amazon and Flipkart:

Jakob’s law teaches us that it is best to research on what your user is used to and implement it to your project.

### 4. Law of Proximity

Law of proximity is a Gestalt principle that states, “ objects or shapes that are close to one another appear to form groups”.
Now lets see a wireframe that portrays law of proximity very well.

Here the website features that have become their own group by using the law of proximity have been highlighted.
By using the law of proximity it is easy for for the user to differentiate each feature on a website in a very effective and efficient manner.

### 5. Zeigarnik Effect

You know that feeling when you open a chocolate thinking that you will have only one piece and the next moment the chocolate is gone. Or when you plan to watch just that one episode and BOOM! sometime later you realize you have finished the whole series. This is Zeigarnik effect.
It states that our brain remembers unfinished or interrupted tasks much better than completed ones.
The example of UX design that fits in this effect very well are partial headlines on all kinds of posts that make you click so that you can finish the sentence.
