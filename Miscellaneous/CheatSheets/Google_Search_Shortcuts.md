# Google Search Shortcuts

### Why the need of this Shortcut Cheatsheet?
Googling require a certain ingenuity and hack in order to find exactly what you are looking for. You don’t have to stop googling if the search engine is not finding your first query. There are many tricks you can use and I like to call this skill: Googling Engineering.

## Literal Search

Use quotation marks at the start and end of the string to make the search more specific
```
"human extinction"
```

## Exclusion

Use - minus symbol to exclude specific content from a generalized area of knowledge
```
python -loops
```

## Searching 

### Between a Range

Use two dots to search for a specific content belonging between that given range
```
react version 2..4
```

### Using OR operator

Getting one type of result or another type of result can be simulated using a OR operator
```
react or next
```

### Comparison

Use vs as a comparison operator to get comparison results between two different/similiar search topics
```
python vs javascript
```


## Specificity

### Site
```
abel roy site:github.io
```

### Sorting by date
```
about react before:1990
```

### Based on Filetype
```
react filetype:pdf
```

### In URL
```
javascript inurl:react-functions
```

### Relation
```
python related:web-development
```
