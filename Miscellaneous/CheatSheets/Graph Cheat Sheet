A graph data structure is a collection of nodes that have data and are connected to other nodes.

Let's try to understand this through an example. On facebook, everything is a node. That includes User, Photo, Album, Event, Group, Page, Comment, Story, Video, Link, Note...anything that has data is a node.

Every relationship is an edge from one node to another. Whether you post a photo, join a group, like a page, etc., a new edge is created for that relationship.

All of facebook is then a collection of these nodes and edges. This is because facebook uses a graph data structure to store its data.

More precisely, a graph is a data structure (V, E) that consists of

A collection of vertices V
A collection of edges E, represented as ordered pairs of vertices (u,v)
And generally there are 2 types of Graphs :- Undirected Graph and Directed Graph

image

Terms used in Graph :-

Adjacency: A vertex is said to be adjacent to another vertex if there is an edge connecting them. Vertices 2 and 3 are not adjacent because there is no edge between them.

Path: A sequence of edges that allows you to go from vertex A to vertex B is called a path. 0-1, 1-2 and 0-2 are paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2.

Directed Graph: A graph in which an edge (u,v) doesn't necessarily mean that there is an edge (v, u) as well. The edges in such a graph are represented by arrows to show the direction of the edge.

Undirected Graph: A graph in which an edge (u,v) mean's that there is an edge (v, u) and they are bi-directional.

Storing our Graph in Data Structure:

There are two ways to store Graph in a Data Structure.

Adjacency Matrix :- An adjacency matrix is a 2D array of V x V vertices. Each row and column represent a vertex. If the value of any element a[i][j] is 1, it represents that there is an edge connecting vertex i and vertex j.
Let's understand how we store data in matrix.
First of all, create a matrix of n + 1 X n + 1
And Intially our 2-D Array will be filled with 0
Since it is an undirected graph, for edge (0,2), we also need to mark edge (2,0)
And as weight of the edge is not given, we'll mark it with 1
image
Let's look at code:-

Java :-

import java.io.*;

class himalik {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		int n = 3, m = 3; 
		int adj[][] = new int[n+1][n+1]; 
		
		// edge 1---2
		adj[1][2] = 1;
		adj[2][1] = 1; 
		
		
		// edge 2---3
		adj[2][3] = 1; 
		adj[3][2] = 1; 
		
		
		// adge 1--3
		adj[1][3] = 1;
		adj[3][1] = 1; 
		
	}
}
There'fore General Representation :-

adj[u][v] = 1
adj[v][u] = 1
Disadvantage of using Adjacency Matrix : Edge lookup(checking if an edge exists between vertex A and vertex B) is extremely fast in adjacency matrix representation but we have to reserve space for every possible link between all vertices(V x V), so it requires more space.
For example the range of matrix we have given is 10^5 then, 10^5 X 10^5 will be out of bound [M.L.E]

To Optimise it we use >> Adjacency List : An adjacency list represents a graph as an array of linked lists. The index of the array represents a vertex and each element in its linked list represents the other vertices that form an edge with the vertex.
Let's understand how we store data in list, taken an example.

Let's look at code:-

Java

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*; 

class himalik {
	public static void main (String[] args) {
		int n = 3, m = 3; 
		ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer> > adj = new ArrayList<>();
		
		for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) 
			adj.add(new ArrayList<Integer>());
		
		// edge 1---2
		adj.get(1).add(2); 
		adj.get(2).add(1);
		
		
		adj.get(u).add(v);
		adj.get(v).add(u);
		
		// edge 2---3
		adj.get(2).add(3);
		adj.get(3).add(2);
		
		
		// adge 1--3
		adj.get(1).add(3);
		adj.get(3).add(1);
		
		
		for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) { 
			for (int j = 0; j < adj.get(i).size(); j++) { 
				System.out.print(adj.get(i).get(j)+" "); 
			} 
			System.out.println(); 
		}
		
	}
}
There'fore General Representation :-

adj.get(u).add(v) = 1
adj.get(v).add(u) = 1
An adjacency list is efficient in terms of storage because we only need to store the values for the edges. For a graph with millions of vertices, this can mean a lot of saved space.

Space Complexity :-

For Undirected Graph :- BigO(N + 2 * E), where N is node & E is edge

For Directed Graph :- BigO(N + E), where N is node & E is edge

                                                        # Connected Components In A Graph
A connected component is the portion of a graph in which there is a path from each vertex to another vertex.
You can think it like this, when a graph is broken into several components, but those components are connected through vertex.

image

Let's break this graph into components,

image

Now, to Traverse this disconnected graph and check it's components. We gonna have one "visited [] array"
       -------------------------------------
vis[] =| 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
       -------------------------------------
index=>	 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8
For the traversing we going to use either dfs OR bfs

The basic code will be like:-

for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
	if(!vis[i]){
		"dfs" OR "bfs"
	}
}
                                                         # Breadth-First Search (BFS)
BFS is a traversing algorithm where you should start traversing from a selected node (source or starting node) and traverse the graph layerwise thus exploring the neighbour nodes (nodes which are directly connected to source node). You must then move towards the next-level neighbour nodes.

A standard BFS implementation puts each vertex of the graph into one of two categories:

Not Visited --> An array with all values initialised with 0.
Visited --> An array with values updated from 0 to 1.
The purpose of the algorithm is to mark each vertex as visited while avoiding cycles.

The algorithm works as follows:

Start by putting any one of the graph's vertices at the back of a queue.

Take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.

Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add the ones which aren't in the visited list to the back of the queue.

Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until the queue is empty.

ANALYSIS :-

Time Complexity :- BigO(N+E) where N = Nodes , E = travelling through adjacent nodes

Space Complexity :- BigO(N+E) + O(N) + O(N) where Space for adjacency list, visited array, queue data structure

                                                                     # Depth-First Search (DFS)
Depth First Traversal is a traversal technique/algorithm, used to traverse through all the nodes in the given graph.

It starts traversal through any one of its neighbour nodes and explores the farthest possible node in each path/branch and then starts Back-tracking.

Backtracking happens when the DFS algorithm reaches a particular node that has no neighbours to visit further, once it reaches that node with no neighbours to be visited it’ll backtrack to its previous node (say N) and from this node N algorithm will start searching for unvisited neighbour nodes and starts visiting them.

Approach:

Start with a random node from graph

Make an array to keep track of visited nodes, once visited mark that node as visited

Print this current node

Get neighbour nodes and perform above steps recursively for each node deeply/depthly if node is unvisited.

In this we have to check wether a cycle present in Undirected graph.

Intuition :-
The intuition behind this is to check for the visited element if it is found again, this means the cycle is present in the given undirected graph.

image

Approach :-

For the first component, firstly we insert the first element of the graph by marking it as visited in the Queue having prev of the first element as -1. Now we pop out that element and traverse the adjacent element list for that and then insert the elements in the Queue and continue the process until no adjacent element is found for the present element. Here, we can see that no loop is formed. So, we return false for the first component.

image

For the second component, a similar process will be done as we have done for the first component. Here we will be able to see that when we come to 7, 8 is one of the next adjacent ones which matters to us, and also, it is already marked as positive. This means someone is linked already with this element. So, it forms a loop and we return true finally.

ANALYSIS :-

Time Complexity :- BigO(N+E) Where N is the time taken and E is for traveling through adjacent nodes overall.

Space Complexity :- BigO(N+E) + O(N) + O(N) where space for adjacent list , array and queue

                                                           # Detect A Cycle In Undirected Graph {D F S}
So, the problem description is same as above one.

To solve this we going to run a for loop from the first node to the last node and check if the node is visited. If it is not visited then call the function recursively which goes into the depth as known as DFS search and if you find a cycle you can say that there is a cycle in the graph.

Basically calling the isCyclic function with number of nodes and passing the graph
Traversing from 1 to number of nodes and checking for every node if it is unvisited

If the node is unvisited then call a function checkForCycle, that checks if there is a cycle and returns true if there is a cycle.

Now the function checkForCycle has the node and previous of the parent node. It will also have the visited array and the graph that has adjacency list

Mark it as visited and then traverse for its adjacency list using a for loop.

Calling DFS traversal if that node is unvisited call recursive function that checks if its a cycle and returns true

If the previously visited node and it is not equal to the parent we can say there is cycle again and will return true

Now if you have traveled for all adjacent nodes and all the DSF have been called and it never returned true that means we have done the DSF call entirely and now we can return false, that mean there is no DSF cycle

Definition :-
A bipartite graph (or bigraph) is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets and , that is every edge connects a vertex in to one in. Source :- Wikipedia
image

Okay so in simple terms, A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two colors such that vertices in a set are colored with the same color. Note that it is possible to color a cycle graph with even cycle using two colors. For example, see the following graph.
image

It is not possible to color a cycle graph with odd cycle using two colors.

So, with the help of an example, let's see whether a graph is bipartite or not.

To, solve it we gonna use the help of Queue and a color array

                                                  # Cycle Detection In Directed Graph (D F S)
A cycle involves at least 2 nodes. The basic intuition for cycle detection is to check whether a node is reachable when we are processing its neighbors and also its neighbors’ neighbors, and so on.
Look at this example what I mean

We can see that 7 is reachable through 8 and 9. We can use the normal DFS traversal with some modifications to check for cycles.

                                                  # Topological Sort (D F S)
First of all let’s understand Topological Sorting. It means linear ordering of vertices such that there is an edge u—-> v, u appears before v in the ordering.

Let's take an example,
image

Some of the possible Topological orders can be:

5,4,2,3,1,0

4,5,2,3,1,0

In both cases we can see, that
4->0 ( 4 appears before 0 ) , 5>3 ( 5 appears before 3 ), …

Similarly there can be multiple toposorts order for the given graph but the condition should be if there is an edge u->v then u should always appear before v.

Topological Sorting is applicable only for DAG(Directed Acyclic Graph). Why is it so?
Because of the following reasons:

Specifically, only u->v is not applicable for undirected graphs. It is uncertain if the edge (u-v) lies between u and v or v and u.
There will always be a dependence factor in a circular graph. You cannot guarantee that the vertices will be arranged linearly.
Finally, you now fully get what Topological Sorting is.
To fix the issue, we'll use the DFS (Depth First Search) approach.
Each vertex's neighbouring vertex will be explored for each vertex in turn.
Following exploration, the current vertex will be stored in a data structure to preserve Topo Sort.
We will be using the following data structure to get Topo sort:

Visited Vector – To store visit of each vertex
Stack – To maintain the topo sort order.

Aside from utilising Stack, did you notice anything else? just because u had an edge over v. From u to v, the DFS call will travel. Initial, the first dfs (v), and then dfs (u). Here, we are ensuring that if u->v, v will be placed onto the stack first, followed by u. This is how the Stack maintains topological order.

                                                  # Topological Sort (B F S) "OR" KAHN'S ALGORITHM
Topological sorting for Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a linear ordering of vertices such that for every directed edge uv, vertex u comes before v in the ordering. Topological Sorting for a graph is not possible if the graph is not a DAG.
For example, a topological sorting of the following graph is “5 4 2 3 1 0?. There can be more than one topological sorting for a graph. For example, another topological sorting of the following graph is “4 5 2 0 3 1″. The first vertex in topological sorting is always a vertex with an in-degree of 0 (a vertex with no incoming edges).

Now, let's talk about how we can solve this using BFS, or How's Kahn's Algorithm helps us.

So, In this instead of using visited array we going to use array of indegree. Now some of you may will ask, dude wait but what is indegree?

Well I forgot to tell you in the very beginning about degree & indegree!!
Here's the quick understanding:-

OutDegree :- Outdegree of vertex V is the number of edges which are going out from the vertex V.
InDegree :- Indegree of vertex V is the number of edges which are coming into the vertex V.
So, more you understand this while we solve the problem, now let's get back to the problem again.

The data Structure we use to solve this problem is:-

> Queue :- The queue will store the "0" indegree vertex only
> Indegree Array :- We will going to have all kind of vertex whose indergree is 0 or greater then 0. 
(If indegree of a vertex is greater then 0, we going to decrement it until 0)
Now, let's understand this problem using an example,
image

Our First job is to fill the indegree array with the degree as per the node/vertex
image

Now as you can, see we have done that. Now our next job is to push 0 vertex in the queue i.e. we have 4 & 5 & after doing that we have to reduce it's adjacent node value by 1. In our case node 4 adjacent are 0 & 1 & node 5 adjacent are 0 & 2
image

Now do the same for node 5
image

Now, next 0 indegree vertex/node we have is 0
image

Next is 2 with indegree 0 & it's adjacent is 3 so decrement it value by 1
image

Next is 3 with indegree 0 & it's adjacent is 1 so decrement it value by 1
image

Finally 1 whose indegree is 0 now so, put it into the queue & no one is adjacent to it's
image
