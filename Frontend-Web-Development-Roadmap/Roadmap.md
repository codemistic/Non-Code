Roadmap for Frontend Web Development

<strong>Step 1: Inroduction</strong> 

The most important and mandatory part to get started with any new technologi is to get sufficient knowledge about it.
To excel Frontend Web Development you have to know two things;

<strong>Step 3: Learn HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</strong>

HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web applications.
HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and which looks in a
nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains different content.

<strong>Step 4: Learn CSS (Cascading Style Sheet)</strong>

Cascading Style Sheets, fondly referred to as CSS, is a simple design language intended to simplify the process of making web pages presentable.
CSS handles the look and feel part of a web page. Using CSS, you can control the color of the text, the style of fonts, the spacing between
paragraphs, how columns are sized and laid out, what background images or colors are used, layout designs,variations in display for different
devices and screen sizes as well as a variety of other effects.

<strong>Step 5: Learn JavaScript</strong>

JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose implementations
allow client-side script to interact with the user and make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with object-oriented  
capabilities.

<strong>Step 6: Learn Version Control</strong>

Version control systems are a category of software tools that helps in recording changes made to files by keeping a track of modifications done
in the code. Basically Version control system keeps track on changes made on a particular software and take a snapshot of every modification.
Let’s suppose if a team of developer add some new functionalities in an application and the updated version is not working properly so as the
version control system keeps track of our work so with the help of version control system we can omit the new changes and continue with the
previous version.

<strong>Step 7: Understanding Pacakge Manager</strong>

A package manager keeps track of what software is installed on your computer, and allows you to easily install new software, upgrade software to newer
versions, or remove software that you previously installed. As the name suggests, package managers deal with packages: collections of files that are
bundled together and can be installed and removed as a group.

<strong>Step 8: Learn Build Tools</strong>

Build tools are programs that automate the creation of executable applications from source code. Building incorporates
compiling, linking and packaging the code into a usable or executable form. In small projects, developers will often
manually invoke the build process.

<strong>Step 9: Learn JS Framework/Library</strong>

Frameworks and libraries are code written by third parties to solve regular/common problems or to optimise performance.
A key difference between the two is the inversion of control. When using a library, the control remains with the developer
who tells the application when to call library functions.
