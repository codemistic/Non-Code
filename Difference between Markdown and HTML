Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Markdown is different from HTML in that it is a plain text format that can be converted to HTML. HTML is a markup language that is used to create structured documents.
