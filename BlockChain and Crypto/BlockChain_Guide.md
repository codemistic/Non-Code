# Blockchain Learning Resources
[Back to the Top](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Blockchain-Guide#table-of-contents)

[Blockchain](https://www.blockchain.com/) is a distributed database meaning that the storage devices used for the database are not all connected to a common processor. It maintains a growing decentralized digital list of ordered records, called blocks. Each block has a timestamp and a link to a previous block. By the system being decentralization it allows for complete transparency in all shared information.

## C/C++ Learning Resources

[C++](https://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/) is a cross-platform language that can be used to build high-performance applications developed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as an extension to the C language.

[C](https://www.iso.org/standard/74528.html) is a general-purpose, high-level language that was originally developed by Dennis M. Ritchie to develop the UNIX operating system at Bell Labs. It supports structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. C also provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions, which makes it one was of the most widely used programming languages today.

[Embedded C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C) is a set of language extensions for the C programming language by the [C Standards Committee](https://isocpp.org/std/the-committee) to address issues that exist between C extensions for different [embedded systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_system). The extensions hep enhance microprocessor features such as fixed-point arithmetic, multiple distinct memory banks, and basic I/O operations. This makes Embedded C the most popular embedded software language in the world.

[VSCode-Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/vscode-rust) is plugin that adds language support for Rust to Visual Studio Code. Rust support is powered by a separate language server - either by the official Rust Language Server (RLS) or rust-analyzer, depending on the user's preference. If you don't have it installed, the extension will install it for you (with permission). This extension is built and maintained by the Rust IDEs and editors team with the focus on providing a stable, high quality extension that makes the best use of the respective language server.

[Miri](https://github.com/rust-lang/miri) is an interpreter for Rust's mid-level intermediate representation. It can run binaries and test suites of cargo projects and detect certain classes of undefined behavior. Miri will alsowill also tell you about memory leaks: when there is memory still allocated at the end of the execution, and that memory is not reachable from a global static, Miri will raise an error.

[Chalk](https://rust-lang.github.io/chalk/book/) is an implementation and definition of the Rust trait system using a PROLOG-like logic solver.

[stdarch](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/core/arch/) is Rust's standard library vendor-specific APIs and run-time feature detection.

[Simpleinfra](https://github.com/rust-lang/simpleinfra) is rep that contains the tools and automation written by the Rust infrastructure team to manage our services. Using some of the tools in this repo require privileges only infra team members have.

[Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) is a small set of exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code.

[Krustlet](https://krustlet.dev/) acts as a Kubernetes Kubelet(written in Rust) by listening on the event stream for new pods that the scheduler assigns to it based on specific Kubernetes [tolerations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/). The project is currently experimental.
