# React Native VS. Expo

Planning to build a cross-platform app? There are two popular ways to create a React Native app

- you can use the Expo CLI
  or
- you can use the React Native.

You may get confused while choosing between React Native or Expo.

So which one is better for the development of your app? Let’s run a profound analysis

### **_>> What is React Native init ?_**

Generates a plain react native project with separate native projects for iOS and Android platforms.

You can modify the native projects as you want writing native code for each platform. For eg. a very generic use case is that you may want to integrate an Analytics SDK into your app, for that you can you actually use the native iOS and Android projects and integrate your SDK as you want writing the native code.

### **_>> What is Expo ?_**

Expo is a toolchain based on React Native that will help you set up applications quickly. It provides many tools for the process of developing and testing Native React applications and provides you with the user interface and service components typically found in third-party Native React Native components.

Expo offers you the Expo SDK, which you can use for some local mobile functions, like BarcodeScanner, MapView, ImagePicker, etc., so we can define Expo as a framework and as an ecosystem. However, if you use Expo CLI to develop applications, you can only use the Expo ecosystem.

### **_>> Pros and Cons of React Native_**

Benefits of React Native from a development perspective

- Higher App development speed and lower cost
- Good User Experience
- Low maintenance cost
- easy to get your apps listed in AppStore and Play Store.
- Quick and easy idea validation with MVP

Benefits of React Native from a development perspective

- Easy to work with
- Quick iteration cycles
- Intelligent debugging tools
- A large community of developers
- Code reusability

Disadvantages of React Native:

- Not efficient for complex interfaces
- Lack of some custom modules

### **_>> Pros and Cons of Expo_**

Advantages of using Expo

- Publish Over The Air (OTA) Updates Instantly
- Integrated Access To The Native API
- The Fastest Way To Build React Native Apps
- You Don’t Need To Know Native Mobile Coding

Limitations

- Not All iOS And Android APIs Are Available
- Build’s Production May Be Delayed
- Your Application Requires Background Code Execution
- You Cannot Select A Push Notification Service

### **_>> Conclusion_**

As you see, both ways have their respective pros and cons. So which one is better to use? It depends.You may choose Expo for developing MVP projects. It allows you to develop a working product very fast. You can make the app scalable and add extra features and continue working with the app.

Expo and React Native are awesome tools to create apps. The only important thing is to understand the demands of your projects. Then it will be easy to choose which one to use.

Thank You!
Happy Coding!!
