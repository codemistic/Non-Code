To get introduced to SQL, we first need to know about Databases and Database Management Systems(DBMS).<br/>
Data is basically a collection of facts related to some object. A Database is a collection of small units of data arranged in a systematic manner. A Relational Database Management System is a collection of tools that allows the users to manipulate, organize and visualize the contents of a database while following some standard rules that facilitate fast response between the database and the user side.

# SQL Features
SQL allows us to interact with the databases and bring out/manipulate data within them. Using SQL, we can create our own databases and then add data into these databases in the form of tables.

The following functionalities can be performed on a database using SQL:

**Create** or **Delete** a Database.<br/>
**Create** or **Alter** or **Delete** some tables in a Database.<br/>
**SELECT** data from tables.<br/>
**INSERT** data into tables.<br/>
**UPDATE** data in tables.<br/>
**DELETE** data from tables.<br/>
**Create** Views in the database.<br/>
**Execute** various aggregate functions.
