# Definition of Markdown

John Gruber is the original creator of Markdown, and he defines it as:

“Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).”


Gruber’s definition shows that Markdown intended for anyone producing content on the web – which nowadays pretty much for anyone. Markdown is open source free software, which means that anyone can use it.

# Why do we use Markdown?
Markdown is a simple, beginner-friendly way to format plain text. It’s not the best tool for everything, but it definitely has its place. Here’s an analogy that might help:

If you had an intensive project building furniture, a nail gun would be helpful. It’s fast and powerful. But, if you were hanging up a picture on your wall, a nail gun wouldn’t be right for the job — a hammer and a nail would work just fine and be just as fast.

Similarly, Markdown may not be as full-featured as HTML, but it’s fast, simple, and beginner-friendly. In fact, you may use it from time to time already. Reddit and GitHub both encourage users to format their comments using Markdown. You can also use it in text editors like Evernote.

# How does Markdown work?
Gruber, who we heard from earlier, goes on to explain that Markdown is composed of two things:

A plain text formatting syntax.
A software tool, written in Perl, that converts plain text formatting to HTML.
  
# Markdown versus HTML

Markdown is easier to write than HTML, and it's easier for most humans to read Markdown source than HTML source. However, HTML is more expressive (particularly regarding semantic tagging) and can achieve some specific effects that might be difficult or impossible in Markdown. 
In the end, which one to use is primarily a matter of personal preference however, if your team or your document template already uses one or the other, it may be best to use whatever they use.
