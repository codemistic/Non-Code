# Google Search Shortcuts

### Why the need of this Shortcut Cheatsheet?
Googling require a certain ingenuity and hack in order to find exactly what you are looking for. You donâ€™t have to stop googling if the search engine is not finding your first query. There are many tricks you can use and I like to call this skill: Googling Engineering.

## Literal Search

Use quotation marks at the start and end of the string to make the search more specific
```
"human extinction"
```

## Exclusion

Use - minus symbol to exclude specific content from a generalized area of knowledge
```
python -loops
```

## Searching 

### Between a Range

Use two dots to search for a specific content belonging between that given range
```
react version 2..4
```

### Using OR operator

Getting one type of result or another type of result can be simulated using a OR operator
```
react or next
```

### Comparison

Use vs as a comparison operator to get comparison results between two different/similiar search topics
```
python vs javascript
```


## Specificity

### Site
```
abel roy site:github.io
```

### Sorting by date
```
about react before:1990
```

### Based on Filetype
```
react filetype:pdf
```

### In URL
```
javascript inurl:react-functions
```

### Relation
```
python related:web-development
```
