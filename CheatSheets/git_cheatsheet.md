## Git and GitHub

**Git** and **GitHub** are **not** the same thing.<br/> 
**Git** is an open-source, version control tool created in 2005 by developers working on the Linux operating system;<br/> 
**GitHub** is a company founded in 2008 that makes tools which integrate with git.<br/> 
You do not need GitHub to use git,but you cannot use GitHub without using git.<br/> <br/> 
There are many other alternatives to GitHub, such as GitLab, BitBucket,
and “host-your-own” solutions such as gogs and gittea. All of these are referred to in git-speak as “remotes”,
and all are completely optional. You do not need to use a remote to use git, but it will make sharing your code with others easier.
