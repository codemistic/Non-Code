DESCRIBING FRONT-END!
Front-end developers make all the websites we visit, the e-commerce sites we shop at, the blogs we read,
and so forth, user-friendly and aesthetically beautiful.

The front end and the back end are the two main facets of web development to take into account while creating websites and web apps.

As the name suggests, front-end development is concerned with the user interface of any web application.
The user interacts with this by doing things like clicking buttons, scrolling across pages, filling out forms, and so forth.
This is a web application's client-side functionality.

How long does it take to become a front-end developer is one more concern that most people have.
