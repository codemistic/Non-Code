# What is Competitive Programming ?

It is a mind Sport where programmer is given some problem and he/she is required to give an optimized solution under various constraints by using their programming skills. This sport tests our Logical thinking, Analytical Thinking, Pattern Recognition, Pressure Handling, and most importantly knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms.
- It is a very good brain workout. 
- Enhances ability to solve problems. 
- Enhances the pattern recognittion system

You will get used to working on challenging problems. The adrenaline rush you experience when your code gets accepted is just amazing.Every company has a coding test which needs sound knowledge of Data Structures and Algorithms and competitive Programming is all about DS and Algo.

## Getting Started:
1. Choose a programming language suitable to you & learn to code in that and try to learn its stl as well.
2. Learn Data Structures and Algorithms according to the language (as there can be difference in naming and working of few data structures).
3. Practice on various platforms and take part in contests.
4. Get Better at contests and try to learn new concepts.

## Few top platforms to practise competitive programming and DSA:
- [Codeforces](www.codeforces.com) (By far the most popular site for competitive programming where you can give contest which occur on an average every 3 days).
- [Codechef](www.codechef.com)  (For begginers starting out cp it's the best to start from as it has division for each type of people and contest are held on an average every 3 days).
- [Leetcode](www.leetcode.com)  (test your data structure knowledge)
- [Atcoder](www.atcoder.com)  (gives you standerd online assesment type questions)
- [A2Oj Ladders](https://a2oj.herokuapp.com/)  (curates problems according to your rating but you can change that too)
- [CSES](https://cses.fi/problemset/)  (lot of standerd dsa and cp problems)

## Platforms where you can learn new and advanced concepts
- [USACO](https://usaco.guide)  (Structured play list to learn concepts).
- [CPalgo](https://cp-algorithms.com/)  (All algorithms and advanced data structures with good examples).
- [Algorithms Live](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlgorithmsLive)  (One of the best place to learn intermediate to advanced concepts).
- [Vivek Gupta](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_xBkUq2z-rbp2mbZal-0cw)  (Advance cp topics, interesting questions etc).
- [Indian Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pn-nUx92Bu8&list=PLQXZIFwMtjoxxLo-0iknkRsAvVQJ7kmrh)  (A lot of topics from beginner to advance).
- [CodeNCode](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrR5BJxc1vZ0fmn0MOpuXQQ)  (Hands down one of the best playlist for number theory).
- [Erricto](https://www.youtube.com/c/Errichto)  (LGM on cf, a lot of tutorials like bs etc, problems solution videos like of atcoder dp).
- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) (All type of standard problems with their variations).

### **Things to keep in mind**
```Never read the editorial or solution when practising on any platform without giving it your all. The key to competitive coding is practise. To become a master at it takes time.```
