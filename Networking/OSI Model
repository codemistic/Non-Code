Open System Interconnection (OSI) model-

  It has seven layer.
  It is used to describe the functions of networking system.
  It interconnect between different product and devices without the regards of their internal structure and technology.
  Communication functions are partitioned into different layers.
  All layers are independent i.e; if anything changes in one layer then the other layers are not affected.
  It has systematic approach to design.

The 7-layers OSI model-
  1.Application :- Software layer
  2.Presentation :- Software layer
  3.Session :- Software layer
  4.Transport :- Heart of OSI
  5.Network :- Hardware layer
  6.Data link :- Hardware layer
  7.Physical :- Hardware layer


Layers Description-

  Physical
    Transmit raw bit stream over the physical medium.
    Example :- USB, Network adapters, etc.

  Data link
    Responsible for transfer of data from one node to another.
    Example :- Ethernet for LAN.

  Network
    Responsible  for establishing, maintaining and terminating connections.
    It routes packets through point to point links.
    Sender’s and receiver’s IP are placed in the header in this layer.
    Example :- Routers.

  Transport
    It provides end to end reliable data transfer, with data encryption, error recovery, flow control.
    It also acknowledge successful data transmission and re-transmit the data if error is found.
    Example :-  TCP, UDP, Port numbers.

  Session
    It is responsible for establishment of connection,maintenance of sessions, authentication, and ensures security.
    Example :- ZIP(Zone Information Protocol)

  Presentation
    It extract data from application layer.
    Example :- HTTP, FTP.

  Application
    It produces the data which is to be transmitted over networks.
    Example :- Application,Browsers.

  *Data flows from application layer to physical layer in sender’s side, then physical layer to application layer in receiver side.
