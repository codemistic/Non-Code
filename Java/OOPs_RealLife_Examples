1. Polymorphism
       -> If one task is performed in different ways is known as polymorphism.
       ->method overloading and method overriding is used to achieve polymorphism.
       Example :A girl 
       She can be many things
                         Mother
                         Singer
                         Student
      a same person can have different roles.
2. Inheritance
     -> One object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object.
     ->It is used to achieve runtime polymorphism
      Example:dogs
           they can have same color
                          same name
                          same size
      but they are not the same dog.
3. Encapsulation
     -> Wrapping up the data into a single unit.
     -> Data abstraction can be achieved by using encapsulation
     Example: A company
     It can have several departments
                         Production Department
                         HR Department
                         Marketing Department
                         all these departments make up a  company.

4. Abstraction
    -> Hiding internal details and showing functionality.
    -> By using abstract class and interface we can achieve abstraction.
    Example:
        A Mobile Phone
        you can do many things like
                            make a call
                            take picture
                            play games 
it doesn't show you the inside process of how its doing the things
The implementation parts are hidden.
