Blockchain Explained to a 5 year old!

Assume you reside in a city with enough parking to accommodate 200 cars at once (assume that the parking space just has a ground floor). 
This parking space features a primary gate that is always closed and only opens when a car enters or exits. 
Let us now examine this single parking structure from various angles -

1) Price: Because a private corporation created this parking area specifically for parking purposes and will shoulder all maintenance costs, 
there will be a hefty renting price for renting out a single parking place.

2) Security: If criminals get entrance to the main door, they can easily gain access to your automobile (stealing its wheels, gasoline, or causing brake damage, etc.).

3) Limit: What if the number of cars in your city increases from 200 to 300? 
The parking space will be insufficient to accommodate all cars, and another private organization will be required to construct a new parking space.

4) Trusted: You have belief in the parking spot provider, and they are in charge of security and dependability.

5) Centralized: Because all of the automobiles are in one structure, we may call it centralised parking.

Let us now change the present circumstance. Assume there are 200 houses in your city, and each of them has two garages. 
To simplify our reasoning, let us assume that each residence only has one car (all cars filling up all the slots of big parking space described above). 
As a result, each property has one empty garage out of the two available. 
Let's imagine the city decides to rent out the extra garage to anyone who wants a parking spot. 
This kind of parking space provision will handle the problem of parking 200 automobiles or more (in the event that people move in and out of the city) without the requirement for a central larger parking space for the entire city.
Similar to the previous scenario, let’s analyze this scenario -

1) Price: Because the second garage was not created specifically for renting, and the cost of upkeep will be little, 
the cost to rent that extra space will be modest in comparison to the large central parking area.

2) Protection: Because each car is kept in a distinct garage, thieves will have to open all of the garages to get access to the cars, 
giving additional security. (Security on blockchain is a little different, but for the sake of simplicity, treat it this way for now!)

3)Limit: As the number of dwellings increases, assuming each new house has extra garage space, the space available to hold more cars will increase. 
As a result, the network of lessees and lessors grows.

4) Untrustworthy: Because no centralized authority supervises these scattered parking spots, 
we presume that certain standards will be established by all participating garage owners for renting out their spaces.

5) Decentralized: Because these parking places are scattered across the city, we may consider them to be decentralised parking.

The above comparison lays the groundwork for comprehending the Blockchain's true technological infrastructure!

The parking model provides a very simple explanation of Blockchain in real-world terms. 
Let us now attempt to match the components of our parking example to the actual technical model -

The large central parking is a centralised system such as AWS, Google Cloud, and others 
(these cloud platforms are also distributed at some level but for the sake of simplicity, we will assume them to be a single entity).
Data and applications are represented by the cars.
The distributed parking system is a decentralised system based on Blockchain.
Wait! We overlooked something.

Blockchain does not apply to all decentralised systems!! Yes, Blockchain is a form of decentralised system with a distinct attribute.

In simple line, Blockchain is a distributed immutable ledget which is completely transparent.

Let's understand the meaning of each wrod used in the definition.

Ledger- A record keeping system designed for financial data.
Distributed Ledger- It is a digital database that runs on a distributed network,
                    There is no central authority to control the distrubuted ledger.
                    Hence, It provides transparency.
Immutable-  Once a data is stord in blockchain it can't be deleted or modified.

Applications of Blockchain- 

1) Product Tracking -> There might be barcode on products which ensures the genuity of the product.
2) Smart Contract -> Under this, money is paid only when the product is delivered. No advance payment.
3) International Wire Transfer -> we can transfer money instantly at any corners of the world.
                                  There is no requirement of middle man like Bank.
                                  No extra fees is required.
4) Healthcare System -> we can use this to store patient history.
