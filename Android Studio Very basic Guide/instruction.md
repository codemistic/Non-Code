# Basic shortcuts
shift + f6 = **rename** everywhere

ctrl + delete + select line = **to delete whole line**

alt + enter = to move to string resources

- wrapcontent = space according to content (*good*)

- matchparent = space according to block

--- delete horizontal bias always

sometime it is **important** to add in gradle -> gradle-module (important)
```
"plugins{
    id   'com.android.application'
    id   'kotlin-android'
    id   'kotlin-android-extensions'
}"
```

~~8.~~ know about difference between sp(scale independent pixel) 
 and dp(distance independent pixel)

always put gravity with text alignment

all caps : can be **T/F**

add `plugin` as : 
    gradle scripts -> build gradle module -> 
    add "kotlin-android-extentions" under plugins ke bracket
    ke baad

on making any clickable button -> use `onclick` method in new activity made 

*alt+enter* = to make view in main activity


edit text for user input -> plain text

**hint** : to tell what to enter

and many more will be update ...

`Update if you know more.`
